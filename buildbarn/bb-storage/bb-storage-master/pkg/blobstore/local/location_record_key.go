// initialization may be provided. This permits mirrored instances to
// each use a different offset basis.
//
// In the unlikely event that the collision rate on the hash table
// becomes too high, records may simply get lost. By letting mirrored
// instances use different offset bases, it becomes less likely that
// both instances lose the same record.
//
// For non-persistent setups, it is advised to use a randomly chosen
